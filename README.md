# GuitarCatalog

A PHP website I created back at the end of 2016 where you can find electric guitars using a search box or filter by price, manufacturer, string amount, or left/right hand guitars. It contains a backend to upload and edit guitars on the website.

# What I Learned

* Filter results using PHP/MySQL
* Creating an admin section of the site with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features 
* Responsive Design/Bootstrap
* PHP Form Validation and preventing SQL Injections

# See it in action
